[DEPRECATED]

This project has reached the end of its development as a cryptographic library
for rust. Feel free to browse the code, and feel free to use it, but it will
not see any more updates (unless a security issue arises, those will be fixed).

The cryptographic landscape of rust has vastly changed since this library was
introduced to the community, and we believe that if you need a featureset that
goes beyond what this library delivers there are other libraries that would
work well.

It's been fun, but the last couple of years I haven't been able to give this
library the attention I feel that it deserves, so now it's time to formally
deprecate it.

> [NaCl](http://nacl.cr.yp.to) (pronounced "salt") is a new easy-to-use high-speed software library for network communication, encryption, decryption, signatures, etc. NaCl's goal is to provide all of the core operations needed to build higher-level cryptographic tools.
> Of course, other libraries already exist for these core operations. NaCl advances the state of the art by improving security, by improving usability, and by improving speed.

> [Sodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium) is a portable, cross-compilable, installable, packageable fork of NaCl (based on the latest released upstream version nacl-20110221), with a compatible API.

This package aims to provide a type-safe and efficient Rust binding that's just
as easy to use.
Rust >= 1.36.0 is required because of mem::MaybeUninit.

## Basic usage

### Cloning
```
git clone https://github.com/sodiumoxide/sodiumoxide.git
cd sodiumoxide
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Building
```
cargo build
```

### Testing
```
cargo test
```

### Documentation
```
cargo doc
```

Documentation will be generated in target/doc/...

Most documentation is taken from NaCl, with minor modification where the API
differs between the C and Rust versions.

### Support for the AES AEAD Variant

The AES AEAD variant `crypto_aead_aes256gcm` requires hardware support for the
`AES` and `CLMUL` instruction set extensions to x86; you can read why that's the
case
[here](https://doc.libsodium.org/secret-key_cryptography/aead/aes-256-gcm#limitations). These instruction set extensions were first made
available in Intel Westmere (early 2010) and at the time of writing x86 hardware
support for them is near universal.

Libsodium exposes an API for runtime feature detection and doesn't prevent
you from calling `crypto_aead_aes256gcm` on a machine lacking `AES` and
`CMUL` expressions; doing so will result in a runtime `SIGILL` (illegal
instruction). By contrast sodiumoxide exposes an API that precludes the use of
the `crypto_aead_aes256gcm_*` family of functions without performing the runtime
check. It's important to note that the use of `sodiumoxide::init()` is mandatory
when using AES; unless you call `init` calls `aead::aes256gcm::Aes256Gcm::new()`
will always return `Err(_)` even if your runtime hardware supports AES.

## Dependencies

C compiler (`cc`, `clang`, ...) must be installed in order to build libsodium from source.

## Extended usage

This project contains a snapshot of libsodium and builds it by default, favouring a statically-built, fixed version of the native library.

Although it is highly recommended to use the default way with the pinned version, there are several ways you may want to use this crate:
* link it against the library installed on your system
* link it against a precompiled library that you built on your own

You can do this by setting environment variables.

|Name|Description|Example value|Notes|
| :- | :-------- | :---------- | :-- |
|`SODIUM_LIB_DIR`|Where to find a precompiled library|`/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/`|The value should be set to the directory containing `.so`,`.a`,`.la`,`.dll` or `.lib`|
|`SODIUM_SHARED`|Tell `rustc` to link the library dynamically|`1`|Works only with `SODIUM_LIB_DIR`. We check only the presence|
|`SODIUM_USE_PKG_CONFIG`|Tell build.rs to find system library using pkg-config|`1`|We check only the presence|
|`SODIUM_DISABLE_PIE`|Build with `--disable-pie`|`1`|Certain situations may require building libsodium configured with `--disable-pie`. Useful for !Windows only and when building libsodium from source. We check only the presence|

### Examples on *nix

#### Using pkg-config

(Ubuntu: `apt install pkg-config`, OSX: `brew install pkg-config`, ...)

```
export SODIUM_USE_PKG_CONFIG=1
cargo build
```

#### Using precompiled library

See https://download.libsodium.org/doc/installation.

```
export SODIUM_LIB_DIR=/home/user/libsodium-1.0.20/release/lib/
export SODIUM_SHARED=1
cargo build
```

## Optional features

Several [optional features](http://doc.crates.io/manifest.html#usage-in-end-products) are available:

* `std` (default: **enabled**). When this feature is disabled,
  sodiumoxide builds using `#![no_std]`. Some functionality may be lost.

* `serde` (default: **enabled**). Allows serialization and deserialization of
  keys, authentication tags, etc. using the
  [serde library](https://crates.io/crates/serde).

* `benchmarks` (default: **disabled**). Compile benchmark tests. Requires a
  nightly build of Rust.
